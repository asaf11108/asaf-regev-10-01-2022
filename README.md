[Deployed App](https://master.d3gu4qyc5vhimx.amplifyapp.com/).

## API notes
1. I used the following API to fetch data: https://developer.accuweather.com/.
2. Please note that you'll need to [enable cors](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo).
3. This free API enables `50 requests` per day for some API key, if a request failed the app we'll fetch `mock data`.
